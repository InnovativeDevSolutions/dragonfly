# Introduction

Welcome to **ArmaDragonflyClient**, an ultra-fast in-memory database designed specifically for Arma 3 mission and mod developers.

## What is ArmaDragonflyClient?

ArmaDragonflyClient is a powerful persistence solution for Arma 3 that provides:

- **Blazing Performance**: Ultra-fast data operations powered by DragonflyDB and C# .NET 8
- **Redis-Compatible API**: Familiar, easy-to-use commands for data manipulation
- **Production Ready**: Built on DragonflyDB, a proven Redis alternative designed for modern workloads
- **Persistent Storage**: Save to disk with DragonflyDB's efficient snapshot and AOF mechanisms
- **Context-Aware**: Seamless Steam ID integration for player-specific data

## Why ArmaDragonflyClient?

Traditional Arma 3 persistence solutions often suffer from:

- Slow database operations blocking gameplay
- Complex setup and configuration
- Limited data structure support
- Poor scalability for large player bases

ArmaDragonflyClient solves these problems by leveraging DragonflyDB, a high-performance in-memory datastore that's 25x faster than traditional databases. This means:

::callout{icon="i-lucide-zap" color="primary"}
**Unmatched performance** - DragonflyDB's multi-threaded architecture delivers microsecond latency
::

::callout{icon="i-lucide-package" color="secondary"}
**Simple to use** - Familiar Redis-style commands that mission makers already know
::

::callout{icon="i-lucide-shield" color="neutral"}
**Battle-tested** - DragonflyDB is used in production by companies handling millions of requests
::

## Use Cases

ArmaDragonflyClient is perfect for:

- **Player Progression**: Save player stats, skills, and experience
- **Persistent Bases**: Store building placements and base state
- **Inventory Systems**: Manage player gear and loadouts
- **Mission State**: Save and restore mission progress
- **Leaderboards**: Track player scores and achievements
- **Vehicle Persistence**: Save vehicle locations and modifications
- **Economy Systems**: Manage player money and trading
- **High-Traffic Servers**: Scale to thousands of concurrent operations

## Architecture

ArmaDragonflyClient consists of three components:

1. **DragonflyDB Server**: The ultra-fast in-memory datastore (runs separately)
2. **C# Extension** (`.dll`/`.so`): Native library handling database communication
3. **SQF Functions**: Arma 3 script functions for easy integration

The extension communicates with DragonflyDB using the Redis protocol and supports:

- **Key-Value Store**: Simple key-value pairs
- **Hash Store**: Nested key-field-value structures (like Redis hashes)
- **List Store**: Ordered lists with positional operations

## Performance

ArmaDragonflyClient is designed for extreme speed:

- All operations execute in **microseconds**
- DragonflyDB's multi-threaded architecture fully utilizes modern CPUs
- Minimal memory footprint with efficient data structures
- Automatic chunking for large data (>20KB)
- Vertical scalability without complex clustering

## DragonflyDB vs Traditional Solutions

DragonflyDB offers significant advantages:

- **25x faster** than traditional Redis
- **Vertical scaling** - Uses all CPU cores efficiently
- **Lower memory usage** - More efficient data structures
- **Native persistence** - Snapshots and AOF without performance impact
- **Production ready** - Battle-tested in real-world deployments
